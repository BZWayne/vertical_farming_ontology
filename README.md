# A brief introduction to Vertical Farming
A Vertical farming is a technology that allows to harvest the plants. This technology could be usefull for the land, where the land is not suitable for agriculture. For example: mountains, rocky places or cold places. Using this technology, we could use water more effiently, avoid land degrading, provide more effient yield and etc. Vertical Farming is built using **Entities, data properties, object properties and SWRL rules**, and its reasoner used **Pellet**.

## Entities
The list of classes of sub-classes used in Vertical Farming Ontology:
  * VerticalFarming: A vertical farming
  * Mode: Vertical Farming mode
  * Time: A time of the day
  * Plant: is a plant
  * PlantCondition: A plant condition: ready or not ready to pick
  * Sensors: A set of sensors: humiditySensor, temperatureSensor, lightSensor
  * Control: The activity that will be used to control plant grow by using SWRL.
